27 June 2011: mitmproxy 0.5:

    * An -n option to start the tools without binding to a proxy port.

    * Allow scripts, hooks, sticky cookies etc. to run on flows loaded from
      save files.

    * Regularize command-line options for mitmproxy and mitmdump.

    * Add an "SSL exception" to mitmproxy's license to remove possible
      distribution issues.

    * Add a --cert-wait-time option to make mitmproxy pause after a new SSL
      certificate is generated. This can pave over small discrepancies in
      system time between the client and server.

    * Handle viewing big request and response bodies more elegantly. Only
      render the first 100k of large documents, and try to avoid running the
      XML indenter on non-XML data.

    * BUGFIX: Make the "revert" keyboard shortcut in mitmproxy work after a
      flow has been replayed.

    * BUGFIX: Repair a problem that sometimes caused SSL connections to consume
      100% of CPU.
