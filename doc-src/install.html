## Using Pip 

The preferred way to install mitmproxy is to use
[pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). A single command will install the
latest release of mitmproxy, along with all its dependencies:

<pre>
sudo pip install mitmproxy
</pre>


## From Source

- When installing from source, you will need to install the
[dependencies](@!urlTo("intro.html")!@) by hand. 
- Then run the following command from the base of the source distribution:
    
<pre>
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>


## OSX

- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the
command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).
- Install __pip__ using the following command:
    
<pre>
sudo easy_install pip
</pre>

- Now use __pip__ to set up the dependencies and do the install:

<pre>
sudo pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

This procedure may vary if, for instance, you've installed Python from an
external source like [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). In that
case, the easiest way to proceed is to first install __easy_install__, then
continue as above.

There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy
comfortable to use. At the moment, mitmproxy's color scheme is optimized for a
dark background terminal, so you probably want to change the default. You can
use the OSX <b>open</b> program to create a simple and effective
<b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view HTTP bodies:

<pre>
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>
