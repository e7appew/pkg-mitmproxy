## Any tips for running mitmproxy on OSX?

You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program to create a simple and effective
<b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view HTTP bodies:

<pre>
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>


## I'd like to hack on mitmproxy. What should I work on?

There's a __todo__ file at the top of the source tree that outlines a variety
of tasks, from simple to complex. If you don't have your own itch, feel free to
scratch one of those!
