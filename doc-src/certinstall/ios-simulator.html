How to install the __mitmproxy__ certificate authority in the IOS simulator:

<ol class="tlist">

    <li> First, check out the <a
    href="https://github.com/ADVTOOLS/ADVTrustStore">ADVTrustStore</a> tool
    from github.</li>

    <li> Now, run the following command:

    <pre class="terminal">./iosCertTrustManager.py -a ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem</pre>

    </li>

</ol>


Note that although the IOS simulator has its own certificate store, it shares
the proxy settings of the host operating system. You will therefore to have
configure your OSX host's proxy settings to use the mitmproxy instance you want
to test with.
