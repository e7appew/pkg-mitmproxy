- command-line: _--upstream-cert_ 
- mitmproxy shortcut: _o_, then _u_

Normally, mitmproxy uses the target domain specified in a client's proxy
request to generate an interception certificate. When __upstream-cert__ mode is
activated a different procedure is followed: a connection is made to the
specified remote server to retrieve its __Common Name__ and __Subject
Alternative Names__. This feature is especially useful when the client
specifies an IP address rather than a host name in the proxy request. If this
is the case, we can only generate a certificate if we can establish the __CN__
and __SANs__ from the upstream server.

Note that __upstream-cert__ mode does not work when the remote server relies on
[Server Name Indication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication).
Luckily, SNI is still not very widely used.
