This is a loose collection of todo items, in case someone else wants to start
hacking on mitmproxy. Drop me a line (aldo@corte.si) if you want to tackle any
of these and need some pointers.

Targeted for 0.9:
    - White-background colorscheme
    - Extra content view modules: CSS indenter, Flash SWF info extractor
    - Upstream proxy support.
    - Follow mode to keep most recent flow in view
    - Verbose view to show timestamps
    - Search within requests/responses
    - Transparent proxy support
    - Ordering a-la mutt's "o" shortcut


Future:
    - Rewrite the core to be asynchronous. I've done some research, and
    although it's a bit of a bloated monster, it looks like Twisted is the way
    to go.
    - Add some "workspace" features to mitmproxy:
        - Flow comments
        - Copying/duplicating flows
        - Ordering by time, size, etc. a-la-mutt (o keyboard shorcut is reserved for this)
    - Support HTTP Digest authentication through the stickyauth option. We'll
      have to save the server nonce, and recalculate the hashes for each request.
    - Chunked encoding support for requests (we already support it for responses).
    - A progress indicator for large files
